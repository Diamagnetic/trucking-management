Aadil Shaikh

I am grateful to God and my parents 
In past I had a cat 
I usually lie to hide the truth 

Chirag Dhamange - I love cats
Kimiya Sawant - I have never fainted in my life
Rishabh Goyal - I like swimming and gyming and I can swim longest part of pool in one go
Rutvik Yamkanmardi - I got my brases stuck when I tried to kiss a person


Chirag Dhamange
I love cycling
I love cats
I love exercising

Aadil Shaikh: I had a cat in my past
Kimaya Sawant: I have never fainted in my life
Rishabh Goyal: I like swimming and gym and I can wim the longest part in one go
Rutvik Yamkanmardi: I got my braces stuck while kissing
